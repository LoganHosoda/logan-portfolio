Logan-Portfolio v0.1.

This is a rough draft of my portfolio website that is a work-in-progress. There are still several features and layers of polish that I will be adding over time.

Current update priority:

~~1. Media queries for improved responsiveness.~~
2. Navigation bar switches to hamburger menu for mobile.
    Fix navigation buttons to anchor appropriately.
3. About me section.
4. Contact section.
5. Revise footer, add link to this GitHub repo.
6. Navigation animations.
7. Button animations.
8. Project animations.
